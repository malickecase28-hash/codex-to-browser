# ChatGPT Surface Control

Use this skill when a user asks Codex to work with ChatGPT web through a visible browser session, or when a task involves the `codex-chatgpt-control` SDK/plugin.

This skill is for visible, user-directed ChatGPT workflows only. It is not an OpenAI API wrapper, does not call hidden ChatGPT endpoints, and must not bypass login, captcha, product permissions, file permissions, or user confirmation.

## Required Posture

1. Prefer the plugin-bundled SDK facade from `createChatGPTFromEnvironment()`.
2. Use ChatGPT web through a compatible Codex/browser bridge. Do not use private ChatGPT network calls.
3. Treat Codex's connected Browser extension (`extension`) as the plugin
   transport. It may be hosted by the user's Edge or Chrome session. Do not
   select the in-app Browser (`iab`), Browser Harness, Chrome DevTools, CDP,
   or remote-debugging transports from this plugin.
4. Stop on login, captcha, rate-limit, selector-drift, upload/download permission, or ambiguous confirmation blockers.
5. Ask for explicit user confirmation before public, destructive, third-party, paid, account-level, or externally visible actions.
6. Redact run reports by default. Raw prompt/response content is opt-in only.
7. Attach only files the user approved.
8. Load reference files only for the issue at hand; do not read every reference by default.
9. Route local repository editing, terminal execution, testing, and deployment to official Codex capabilities. This plugin controls visible ChatGPT Chat and Work; it does not replace Codex.
10. When the user requests Chat or Work, call `experience.open` for that
    surface before configuration or submission. Do not assume the currently
    visible pane is already correct.

## Plugin Runtime

Resolve relative paths from this `SKILL.md` directory. The plugin runtime lives at:

```text
../../runtime/import-chatgpt-control.mjs
```

From a bridge-enabled Codex Node runtime:

```js
const loaderUrl = new URL(
  "../../runtime/import-chatgpt-control.mjs",
  "file:///absolute/path/to/plugins/codex-chatgpt-control/skills/codex-chatgpt-control/SKILL.md"
);
const { importChatGPTControl } = await import(`${loaderUrl.href}?t=${Date.now()}`);
const { createChatGPTFromEnvironment } = await importChatGPTControl();
const chatgpt = await createChatGPTFromEnvironment();
```

When using this installed plugin, do not import from an older manually installed skill runtime. Use the plugin-bundled runtime so the installed plugin and SDK stay in sync.

## Bridge Bootstrap

The plugin owns the ChatGPT browser workflow. Use the connected `@Browser`
extension as its transport. If the current agent lacks a bridge-hosted Browser
runtime, bootstrap the Browser skill in its supported host and retry the plugin
there. Do not run the SDK in an ordinary shell and then improvise a direct
Chrome-control fallback. Only an explicitly configured terminal provider is a
user-selected alternative; never silently select one or launch remote
debugging:

```js
const { createChatGPTFromEnvironment } = await importChatGPTControl();
const chatgpt = await createChatGPTFromEnvironment();
```

Only a true bridge-hosted run needs the extension bootstrap:

```js
const { setupBrowserRuntime } = await import("<the absolute browser-client.mjs path supplied by the Chrome skill>");
const agent = await setupBrowserRuntime();
const browser = await agent.browsers.get("extension");
await browser.nameSession("🔗 ChatGPT workflow");
```

Use the connected `@Browser` extension workflow. Browser Harness and Chrome
DevTools are opt-in terminal providers only. A `browser_bridge_unavailable`
blocker is valid only after the Browser skill's extension bootstrap was
attempted in its supported host and failed. Do not replace that blocker with a
direct Chrome-control call.

For a true live in-app Browser run from Codex, initialize the browser runtime before using the SDK if `globalThis.agent` is missing. See `references/bridge-bootstrap.md` when bootstrap details are needed.

Do not diagnose user-open Chrome tab availability with `browser.tabs.list()` or `browser.tabs.selected()` alone. When the user says a ChatGPT thread is already open, use `existingTab: true`, an exact `existingTab` policy, or the SDK's existing-tab helpers.

## Basic Runner Flow

```js
const reviewer = chatgpt.agent({
  name: "reviewer",
  instructions: "Review carefully and return Markdown."
});

const result = await chatgpt.runner.run(reviewer, {
  input: "Review this design.",
  thread: { type: "new" },
  experience: "chat",
  response: { format: "markdown" }
});

if (!result.ok) {
  console.log(JSON.stringify(result.interruptions ?? result, null, 2));
} else {
  console.log(result.output_text);
}
```

Instructions are visible prompt text by default. Use `instructionsMode` intentionally:

- `visible_prefix`: include instructions in the submitted user message.
- `visible_setup_message`: submit instructions as a separate visible setup turn.
- `metadata_only`: keep instructions local; they are not sent to ChatGPT.

## Chat And Work Surfaces

Detect the visible surface and inspect its actual capability graph:

```js
const surface = await chatgpt.experience.detect();
const configuration = await chatgpt.configuration.inspect({
  experience: surface.data?.experience === "unknown"
    ? undefined
    : surface.data?.experience
});
```

Open a surface explicitly and apply only verified visible controls:

```js
await chatgpt.experience.open({ experience: "work" });
await chatgpt.configuration.apply({
  experience: "work",
  desired: {
    model: "GPT-5.6 Sol",
    effort: "High",
    speed: "Standard"
  },
  strict: true
});
```

The current home UI may expose Chat and Work as radios in a `Select chat
surface` group. An active Work task may hide that group. Use
`experience.open` in both cases: it verifies the checked pane, returns home
when necessary, and retains legacy button/menu/tab/link fallbacks.

Selector profiles describe observed UI shapes (`chat_legacy_v1`, `chat_simplified_v1`, `work_basic_v1`, and `work_advanced_v1`). They are not plan or entitlement labels. Treat unavailable controls and rollout differences as structured results instead of guessing.

Start Work exactly once, then poll or steer the same task:

```js
const started = await chatgpt.work.start({
  prompt: "Produce a decision-ready implementation brief.",
  newTask: true,
  wait: false,
  read: false
});

const status = await chatgpt.work.status({ includeArtifacts: true });
await chatgpt.work.steer({
  prompt: "Add a prioritized migration sequence.",
  wait: false,
  read: false
});
const latest = await chatgpt.work.readLatest({ format: "markdown" });
```

`newTask` defaults to true. When an existing Work task is loaded and no unique new-task control can be verified, the SDK blocks instead of appending accidentally. Never resubmit a task after a partial or timeout result; use `work.status`, `work.wait`, or `work.readLatest`.

Use `chatgpt-delegate` for the focused surface-neutral delegation workflow. `chatgpt-pro-consult`, `mode`, and `modes.set/get` remain compatibility aliases for existing callers; new work should use `experience` and `configuration`.

## Common Workflows

Classify each request by operation, not by exact wording:

- **Retrieval:** the user asks for existing content, its subject, a summary,
  an explanation, or a paste/export of what is already in the thread. Open the
  target and call `messages.readLatest` only. Never submit the user's wording.
- **Mutation:** the user asks ChatGPT to answer a new question, research,
  analyze, create, continue, revise, investigate, or otherwise perform work.
  Use `askInThread` on the same thread, wait for completion, then read the new
  response. Synonyms and natural-language paraphrases have the same meaning.
- **Compound:** perform retrieval first, then mutation only for the later
  task. Preserve the thread identity across both operations.
- **Ambiguous:** do not guess and do not submit. Report the ambiguity and ask
  which operation the user intends.

The presence of words such as “access,” “result,” “same plugin,” “tell me,” or
“paste” does not decide the route. The requested outcome does. A prior
read-only operation does not make a later task read-only.

```js
await chatgpt.openThread({ type: "url", url: "https://chatgpt.com/c/<conversation-id>" });
const result = await chatgpt.messages.readLatest({ role: "assistant", format: "markdown" });
```

For a follow-up task in that same thread, after the request has been classified
as a mutation:

```js
await chatgpt.askInThread({
  thread: { type: "current" },
  prompt: "Conduct research on bats and report the findings.",
  wait: true,
  read: { format: "markdown" }
});
```

Ask in a new or selected thread:

```js
await chatgpt.ask({
  prompt: "Reply with the word hi.",
  wait: true,
  read: { format: "markdown" }
});
```

Continue an existing thread:

```js
await chatgpt.askInThread({
  thread: { type: "url", url: "https://chatgpt.com/c/<conversation-id>" },
  existingTab: true,
  prompt: "Continue from the latest answer.",
  wait: true,
  read: { format: "markdown" }
});
```

Attach approved files:

```js
await chatgpt.askWithFiles({
  thread: { type: "new" },
  files: ["/absolute/path/to/approved-file.pdf"],
  prompt: "Summarize this file.",
  wait: true,
  read: { format: "markdown" },
  report: { enabled: true, includeContent: false }
});
```

Download an exact generated deliverable without accepting another visible
artifact as success:

```js
await chatgpt.askAndDownload({
  prompt: "Create report.csv and provide it as a downloadable file.",
  download: {
    destDir: "/absolute/output/dir",
    filenamePattern: "^report\\.csv$"
  },
  wait: true,
  read: true
});
```

`filenamePattern` is a case-insensitive regular expression. The runtime handles
both direct file links and current filename-button -> artifact-preview ->
Download flows. A mismatch blocks instead of silently accepting an unrelated
image fallback.

Run a diagnostic before long workflows:

```js
const diagnostic = await chatgpt.doctor({
  check: ["bridge", "login", "upload", "download", "clipboard"]
});
```

## Response Capture

Use Markdown by default for human-readable answers and saved artifacts:

```js
const latest = await chatgpt.messages.waitAndRead({
  role: "assistant",
  format: "markdown"
});
```

Use `format: "normalized_text"` only for compact assertions, polling checks, or simple exact-string smoke tests.

For long Chat, Work, Thinking, Deep Research, or file-backed answers, poll with `chatgpt.messages.wait({ responseContent: "metadata", ... })` or `chatgpt.work.wait(...)` so repeated partial polls return status metadata instead of re-emitting the growing answer body. Call the matching `readLatest({ format: "markdown" })` once completion is confirmed.

See `references/response-capture.md` for fidelity warnings and report handling.

## File Upload Permissions

File attachment workflows need two separate permission gates:

1. Chrome extension gate: open `chrome://extensions`, choose the Codex/browser bridge extension, open Details, and enable `Allow access to file URLs`.
2. Codex app gate: in Codex settings, allow Google Chrome uploads under `Computer Use > Google Chrome > Permissions > Uploads`.

If either gate is missing, stop with a permission blocker and tell the user which gate to check. See `references/file-uploads.md`.

## Blocker Handling

When a run fails, report the structured blocker. Do not retry blindly.

Common blockers:

- `browser_bridge_unavailable`: no bridge-enabled host runtime is available.
- `login_required`: the visible ChatGPT session is not signed in.
- `captcha`: user action is required.
- `permission`: upload/download/clipboard permission is missing.
- `selector_drift`: ChatGPT UI changed and selectors need review.
- `rate_limit`: wait or ask the user how to proceed.
- `needs_confirmation`: the workflow requires explicit user confirmation.

Two mutation outcomes are deliberately non-resumable. Browser-native deadlines terminate these requests before return, so neither can mutate later, but the mutation may already have taken effect. For `stop_generation_unverified`, inspect whether generation is still active and never retry Stop automatically. For `attachment_outcome_indeterminate`, inspect the current composer, do not submit, and never repeat the attachment automatically.

See `references/troubleshooting.md` before diagnosing selector, tab-claim, upload, or bridge issues.

## Validation

For source changes, run the smallest meaningful gate first. For shared SDK/protocol/plugin changes, broaden to:

```bash
cd packages/node
npm run build
npm run bundle
npm run bundle:backend
npm run bundle:live-smoke
npm run bundle:release-canary
npm run contract:validate
npm run parity:fixtures
npm run test:backend-conformance
npm test
```

Plugin packaging gates:

```bash
node tools/public-export/root/scripts/build-plugin-runtime.mjs --root .
node tools/public-export/root/scripts/check-plugin-runtime.mjs --root .
node tools/public-export/root/scripts/validate-plugin-layout.mjs --root .
python3 /path/to/plugin-creator/scripts/validate_plugin.py plugins/codex-chatgpt-control
```

Use public-export validation before claiming the public plugin package is release-ready.

Run the reusable expansion canary through the installed candidate before
claiming Chat/Work support is live-qualified:

```bash
CHATGPT_E2E_SCENARIOS="chat-work-expansion" npm run smoke:live
```

The canary tests the Chat/Work round trip, both configuration graphs, strict
no-op configuration application, Work start/status/wait/read/steer/artifacts,
Work-backed Runner and Responses calls, and Chat restoration. A real Work
setting change is separate and opt-in; it restores the original effort in a
`finally` path:

```bash
CHATGPT_E2E_CONFIGURATION_MUTATION=1 \
CHATGPT_E2E_SCENARIOS="configuration-mutate-restore" \
npm run smoke:live
```

The packaged runtime also includes
`runtime/node/codex-chatgpt-control-release-canary.bundle.mjs`. Import it from a
bridge-hosted JavaScript call and run `runReleaseCanary(globalThis, { tabId })`
against an exact dedicated ChatGPT tab before publishing. It creates sanitized
Chat/Work profiles, exercises the expansion, mutates/restores Work effort,
verifies a generated CSV download, and restores Chat. Upload remains explicit
via `includeUpload: true`.

For locale drift, use the Node package's existing language loop with
`--auto-switch --all --capture-surfaces`; review the JSONL before using the
`--reviewed` apply gate.
